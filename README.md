# Jumble letters
Jumble letters is a tool that mixes up every letter in a sentence except the first and last letters in each word

## Installation
To install Jumble letters you can choose to compile it yourself or download one of our precompiled binaries

### Precompiled binaries
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/IsakTheHacker/jumble-letters/releases) section and download the latest binary (only for Linux at the moment). Put it somewhere you can access it later.

Mark the file as executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x main
```

Now it's done! But you may want to make an alias for it so you don't need to write the full path whenever you want to use it. Append the following line to ~.bashrc:
```
alias jl=<path_to_jumble_letters>
```
